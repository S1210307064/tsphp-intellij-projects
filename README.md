They shall help you to get started contributing to the project.

Very briefly:

1. Clone each component in https://github.com/tsphp/ into one folder 
2. download the templates (either clone the repository or just download the zip)
3. extract the templates in the same folder as the components
4. You should be set up and ready :)
